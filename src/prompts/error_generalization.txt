Based on the explanation of a student’s mistake above, write a response in English that identifies the core grammatical rule the student misunderstood. Describe the rule in one clear, concise paragraph, without using any words or details specific to the original sentence. Focus on the general principle that applies broadly to similar situations. If relevant, include terms that might confuse learners due to translation or differences between languages (for example, words like “is/are,” tense markers, gender agreement, articles, etc.).
After the paragraph, provide three example sentences that show similar mistakes along with their corrected versions. Label each pair clearly as “Incorrect” and “Correct.”
